Question:
You are tasked with designing a small Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for surveillance missions. The UAV must operate efficiently at a cruising speed of 60 m/s and maintain flight stability while carrying a payload of 5 kg.

Aerodynamic Configuration: What is the optimal wing shape (airfoil type) and aspect ratio for achieving the best lift-to-drag ratio at the specified cruising speed? Justify your choice with respect to the design requirements.
Structural Design: Given the materials available (e.g., aluminum, carbon fiber, and composites), which materials would you choose for the wing and fuselage? Discuss the trade-offs in terms of weight, strength, cost, and manufacturability.
Propulsion System: Calculate the required thrust for the UAV to maintain level flight, considering a total aircraft weight of 15 kg (including the 5 kg payload). Assume a drag coefficient of 0.05 at cruise conditions and a lift-to-drag ratio of 12. What type of propulsion system would be most suitable (e.g., electric, gas)? Explain your reasoning.
Stability and Control: Describe the control surfaces needed for flight stability. How would you ensure the UAV is dynamically stable during various flight phases (takeoff, cruise, landing)?
Flight Mission Profile: Outline a basic flight mission profile for the UAV that includes takeoff, cruising, target acquisition, and landing. How would you incorporate redundancy and safety features into your design to mitigate risks associated with UAV operations?
