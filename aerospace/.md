**cross-sectional area** - area of a slice taken perpendicular to the cylinder's length (flat face)  <br>
to describe continuous change, we take a **very thin horizontal layer** of thickness $d_h$

**infinitesimal** instead of zero allows the step :

$$
p-p≈\frac{dp}{dh}dh
$$

"This is effectively a linear approximation or the first-order Taylor expansion of p(h) around the point h."

## multivariable continuity
**continuously varying f()** - small changes in the input(x) result in small, predictable changes in the output(f(x))
